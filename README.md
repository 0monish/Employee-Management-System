# Employee-Management-System

This is a very basic React Js project it doesn't contains the used of any  backend technologies like Node Js. 

The Data is handled through localstorage and also the changes you made like creating task, managing task are temporary as the browser closes all changes will be lost.

I made this for learning purpose.
